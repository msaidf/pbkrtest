	* vcovAdj was very slow on large problems. Thanks to John Fox for
	notification. Reason was that chol and chol2inv was not imported
	from the Matrix package. Fixed now.

	* get_Lb_ddf function and method for linear mixed models added.

	* Lb_ddf function added

	* Version 0.4-1 uploaded

2014-08-11 Søren Højsgaard <sorenh@math.aau.dk>

	* Extended documentation of PBmodcomp

	* model2restrictionMatrix and restrictionMatrix2model functions
	have been added.

	* CITATION file added; references updated to include JSS paper

	* Version 0.4-0 uploaded

2013-11-19 Søren Højsgaard <sorenh@math.aau.dk>

	* get_ddf_Lb and ddf_Lb functions added. They provide adjusted
	degrees of freedom for testing L'beta=0

	* Version 0.3-8 uploaded

2013-09-26 Søren Højsgaard <sorenh@math.aau.dk>

	* Major reorganizing of KR-related code; preparing for the new
	version of lme4 getting on CRAN

	* Package no longer Depends on Matrix, but Imports instead

	* Version 0.3-6 uploaded

2013-07-03 Søren Højsgaard <sorenh@math.aau.dk>

	* Plot method for parametric bootstrap tests improved

	* Vignette improved

	* Version 0.3-5 uploaded

2012-12-03 Ulrich Halekoh <ulrich.halekoh@agrsci.dk>

	* .get_indices() corrected nn.groupFaclevels the number of the
	levels for each random-term-factor
	was erroneoulsy only returned once if a grouping factor
	occurred several times as in
	(1|Subject) + (0+Days|Subject)

     	* furthermore, the calculation of the number of
	random-term-factors n.groupFac was rolled back, due to an
	inconsistency in its definition via (getME(model,'n_rtrms') which
	yieled for the above random term 2 (CRAN) and 1 (FORGE)

	* compiled to Version 0.3-4

2012-11-20 Ulrich Halekoh <ulrich.halekoh@agrsci.dk>

	* LMM_Sigma_G() added. Computes Sigma and the components of G

	* vcovAdj() rewritten  for correct extraction of the
	submatrices of Zt for random effects for different grouping factors.

	* getKR function for extracting slots from KRmodcomp object

	* compiled to Version 0.3-3

2012-08-25 Søren Højsgaard <sorenh@math.aau.dk>

	* Now uses the parallel package instead of snow

	* seed can be supplied to the random number generator

	* Version 0.3-2 uploaded.


2012-04-24 Søren Højsgaard <sorenh@math.aau.dk>

	* Version 0.3-1 uploaded.

2012-02-26 Ulrich Halekoh <ulrich.halekoh@agrsci.dk>

	* function vcovAdj() refits the large model if fitted with REML=FALSE and prints a warning

	* function KRmodcomp() refits the large model if fitted with REML=FALSE and prints a warning
